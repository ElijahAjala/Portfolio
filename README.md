# About Project Management Dashboard

Senior project managers, executives, and business owners of large corporations have struggled to track the progress or decline of their various projects.
This is not due to negligence, but there is a lot of emphasis on operations. My most recent analysis examines the roadmaps, flows, and current positions of projects at the XYZ company.
The dashboard below provides answers to the following questions:
- The amount of cost savings
- The amount of money earned
- The number of projects in various stages
- Project Costs and Benefits by Region
- A comparison of costs and benefits over time
as well as a table displaying the project summary.

This dashboard is a work-made-easy for them as it serves as a model to measure Performance, growth and decline of projects as well as project managers

Take a look at the dashboard, review it, and let me know what you think.
